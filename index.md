## ❄️About Me

I am a Software Engineering candidate with interests in end-end Data and ML/AI lifecycles. Currently I'm pursuing a masters degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the [**University of South Florida**](https://www.usf.edu/). At USF, I assist professors [Varol Kayhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kpwLpyEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shivendu Shivendu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pXpRuHgAAAAJ&hl=en) in their research focused on incorporating **deep learning** techniques within Information Security solutions. I also work towards the cybersecurity training of Florida State Employees funded by the [**Florida Center for Cybersecurity**](https://cyberflorida.org/) at USF. At my last job as a software engineer at [**Rocket Software**](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/products/rocket-tmon-one/rocket-tmon), I built data pipelines and marts to integrate Mainframe products with Cloud analytics platforms. 

 Drop me a message if I can add any value to you!
