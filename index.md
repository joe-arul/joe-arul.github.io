> ❄️About Me

I am a Software Engineering candidate with interests in end-end Data and ML/AI lifecycles. Currently I'm pursuing a masters degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the [**University of South Florida**](https://www.usf.edu/). 
- At USF, I assist faculty in research focused on incorporating NLP techniques within Information Security solutions. 
- I also work towards the cybersecurity training of Florida State Employees funded by the [**Florida Center for Cybersecurity**](https://cyberflorida.org/) at USF. 
- At my last job as a software engineer at [**Rocket Software**](https://www.rocketsoftware.com/products/rocket-tmon-one/rocket-tmon), I worked on integrating Mainframe products with Cloud analytics platforms and maintaining + modernizing legacy software written in z/OS assembly language.
